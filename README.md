# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on machine learning projects — each notebook here is based on real-world case studies, assignments, and experiments that demonstrate various concepts across the ML lifecycle.

From supervised learning and clustering to recommendation systems and business forecasting, these notebooks reflect my journey in building ML solutions with intuition, rigor, and creativity.
